## Using established personalities to tell your brand’s story

Influencers on social media have a reputation from being an expert or spokesperson in a certain topic/niche. They often have built up a large and enthusiastic fanbase/audience who pay attention to their lives. Studies have shown that over 80% of marketers find influencer marketing more effective than other marketing channels. They can represent you to a target audience in a way that resonates more deeply than traditional means of advertising.

Having worked with thousands of influencers from every niche imaginable, our team understands the potential of influencer marketing. From matching your product/service with the right spokesperson to running a mass campaign, we deliver a range of services that can be molded into the needs of any brand. At 005F, we can connect you with influencers best suitable for your brand, curate & create marketing content, plan ad-sets to gather a loyal audience, as well as deliver a roadmap for long-term marketing campaigns.
