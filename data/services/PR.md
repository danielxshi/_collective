## Online media is the frontline of public relations

At 005F, we have developed a system aimed to drive influence across all channels. Our team places a high importance towards building relationships with influencers, editors and reporters and other media outlets. We utilize data to identify behavioural insights to determine which platforms are effective for the specific campaign. Successful influence is built upon public relations which is why we work closely with our team & associates to build campaigns that drive consumers.

Alongside the usual Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and email relations, our strategy is designed to deliver the proper brand message. We have worked with thousands of influencers from a wide variety of niches (financial, educational, and entertainment, to name a few). For each of our clients, we handpick the right tools and metrics needed to maximize the delivery of the proper channels. Different brands require different strategies and we ensure that our system is in alignment with the desired goals.
